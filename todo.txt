//remove button for entire categories

/edit button for both categoies and list items

//make colors of categories changeable both before and after creation -- done
	//im not sure yet how I would do before ---- just made it random
		still have to add some good colors

//change position in line of category panels after creation -- done

//change size (columns) of category panels after creation -- this is next
	//but first lets get some good sizing scheme to begin with -- right now
		//default will be col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12
			//so one size up will be col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12
			//	keep going till col-lg-12 so
			//col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12 col-xs-12
			//col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12
			//col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12

			

	figure out how to let user change sizes of columns in different window sizes? -- maybe later most users wont see a need

BIGTHING: add dates support
	add keybind to what i already have
		I have a to now viewing mode which so far works fine
		and a increment by mode which still needs to be implemented
