				<h2>Im on my way to becoming a developer.</h2>
				<p>It has been perilous and daunting, but my will is unbreakable.</p>

				<p>One of the strengths of my learning style is that I am thorough. If I have a task at hand but I come across a bit of knowledge  sitting there along the side, I am loathe not to pick it up. but this strength can also be a huge weakness</p>	

				<p>The problem comes when I'm working in a very directed way and I come across something that I need to learn to solve the problem at hand, but in the process of learning about that one thing I come across 5 other things that I don't know, and by my very nature are completely unignorable to me. At this point I have to make a decision between the all too tempting notion of going off on the great knowledge adventure of the century and just buckling down and finishing my current project.</p>

				<p>Eventually I figured out that what I need is a way to store gateways to the knowledge (or words that I don't know, concepts I've never heard of, jargon) in a way that gives them context, context both in terms of what knowledge its related to and what type of problems I was solving while I came across said word.</p>

				<p>All of this so that I could come back to them later and check them off as I learned about them.</p>

				<p>in short the bookmarks section of my browser was growing increasingly inadequate</p>

				<h3>what I've done</h3>

				<p>all I've done is take</p>
