Knowledge page: a simple way of organizing your (my) education
==========================================================

One of the strengths of my learning style is that I am thorough. If I have a task at hand but I come across a bit of knowledge  sitting there along the side, I am loathe not to pick it up. but this strength can also be a huge weakness	

The problem comes when I'm working in a very directed way and I come across something that I need to learn to solve the problem at hand, but in the process of learning about that one thing I come across 5 other things that I don't know, and by my very nature, are completely unignorable to me. At this point I have to make a decision between the all too tempting notion of going off on the great knowledge adventure of the century and just buckling down and finishing my current project.

Eventually I figured out that what I need is a way to store gateways to the knowledge (or words that I don't know, concepts I've never heard of, jargon) in a way that gives them context, context both in terms of what knowledge its related to and what type of problems I was solving while I came across said word.

All of this so that I could come back to them later and check them off as I learned about them.

in short the bookmarks section of my browser was growing increasingly inadequate

what my plan is (or was)
========================
once I have this in a workable state I plan to host the page with my specific progress and update it every now and then

so.. working example soon enough!

I am by the way a complete novice at Javascript and programming in general so if, somehow you stumble across this project of mine any tips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
