Knowledge page: a simple way of organizing links
==========================================================

One of the strengths of my learning style is that I am thorough. If I have a task at hand but I come across a bit of knowledge  sitting there along the side, I am loathe not to pick it up. but this strength can also be a huge weakness	

The problem comes when I'm working in a very directed way and I come across something that I need to learn to solve the problem at hand, but in the process of learning about that one thing I come across 5 other things that I don't know, and by my very nature, are completely unignorable to me. At this point I have to make a decision between the all too tempting notion of going off on the great knowledge adventure of the century and just buckling down and finishing my current project.

Eventually I figured out that what I need is a way to store links to pages and tutorials and whatnot in a way that gives them context, context both in terms of what knowledge its related to and what type of problems I was solving while I came across said word.

All of this so that I could come back to them later and check them off as I learned about them.

in short the bookmarks section of my browser was growing increasingly inadequate

if along the way to making this I learn a thing or two about javascript, jquery, or programming that wouldn't be horrible either
